# local-library-django-tutorial

Using [MDN's Django tutorial](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Django/Tutorial_local_library_website) to stretch my Django skills and stay in practice. This may end up being what I use to keep track of my books. 

Just in case I end up needing it later, I skipped the part on permissions [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Django/Authentication)

Something is up with the renewal form - check post pesach
4/16 note: if something's funky it might be the Procfile

don't forget to deploy from master!

NOTE: It deploys! But will have to change databse to postgres
